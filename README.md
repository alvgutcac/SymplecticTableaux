# SymplecticTableaux
A SageMath library implementing symplectic tableaux and symplectic patterns.

### Instalation
To use this locally, save the file in your computer (e.g. in Desktop). Then run a Sage console in this path directory and load the file.
```
sage: cd Desktop
/home/sage/Desktop/
sage: load("SymplecticTableauxNew.sage")
```

### Documentation
Documentation will be generated at a later stage. For now, some functions have some preliminary documentation as docstrings. This can be accessed also from the console.
```
sage: SymplecticTableau.f?
Signature:      SymplecticTableau.f(self, i)
Docstring:         Applies the crystal operator f(i).
Init docstring: Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.
File:           Dynamically generated function. No source code available.
Type:           function
```
